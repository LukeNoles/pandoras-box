# pandoras-boxx
Repo for the CIS368 Agile Development Pandora's Box (TM) 
Web application to incorporate several frivolous user interactions, including:

Jokes

Motivational quotes/pictures

Demotivators

Quotes

Useless button

Redirection to another fun website (Rick Roll, thispersondoesnotexist.com, etc.)

Polls (would-you-rather, etc.)

"Don't click" button (warning against clicking, some mild, negative consequence)

Random facts (interesting, false, or disconcerting)

This should change daily, allowing for shareability and variety

Should include generic HTML/CSS, a source (database) for daily change in interactions, JavaScript for changing interactions and implementing functionality

Implemented APIs:
